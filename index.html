          Hi! My name is Lily West and I've been making art for as long as I can remember. I started making these little designs for fun just cause they made me laugh. Then I made some of them into stickers and found out they made other people laugh too :) I make a lot of other art too that you can see here and on my instagram @kilurb, but I think I have the most fun sharing these, so my little brother helped make me this website! I hope you enjoy and find something that makes you smile.
